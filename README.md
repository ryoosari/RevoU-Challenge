# RevoU-Challenge
Data Analyst Mini Challenge by RevoU

* **Games Sales - RevoU Challenge.csv** is the dataset
* **RevoU Challenge.rmd** is the R Notebook file to show the whole working process from start to finish.

This is a mini challenge given to those who follow RevoU's mini courses. It's a simple task to answer questions given by the stakeholder.

Although I know it can be done easily through Excel/Google Sheets, I challenged myself by finishing this challenge using R.
